# To do: 
# control caused by crossing a threshhold --> seems dependent on time step because if people are reevaluating by fractions of a day, they can respond faster vs if the time step is 1 day?
# add case detection? 
# case importations?
# loss of immunity 
# update parameters to acutally reflect the parameter estimates 
# add some information on the age structure of our population? to estimate fatality rates?
# add hospital capacity affecting mortality?
# add contact tracing as an intervention which will require another category for exposed people who know they are exposed


# define the changes for a time step forward
